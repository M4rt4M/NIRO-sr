      "name": "Statement of need",
      "scope": "protocol",
      "section": "aims",
      "content": {
        "general": "Why is the review needed?\n* No previous review\n* Update to previous review\n* Previous reviews are flawed"
      },
      "rationale": "A systematic review fits within the context of a literature of reviews, and its place in relation to existing reviews should be clarified."
    },

      "name": "Justification",
      "scope": "protocol",
      "section": "aims",
      "content": {
        "general": "Please provide a rationale for the review. Explain how the review will support the field of research and how the review will fit into the progress of research in the field."
      },
      "rationale": "A systematic review is a substantial undertaking, and thus a clear justification is important before beginning."

      "section": "research_question",

        "general": "State the primary review question. Make sure it is clearly defined and includes:\n* The primary effect of interest\n* The independent variable(s) of interest\n* The population of interest (e.g. general public, children, clinical patients)\n* _Covariates of interest_"

      "rationale": "Identifying the primary review question before embarking on review keeps the project manageable and provides clarity for readers comparing the review to its protocol declaration."

        "general": "_If applicable, identify secondary questions such as sources of heterogeneity within identified studies._"
      },
      "rationale": "Secondary questions may arise during the process of systematic review. Declaring secondary questions identified before review begins allows them to be differentiated from exploratory questions prompted by the review process."

      "name": "Statement of hypothesis",
      "scope": "protocol",
      "section": "research_question",
      "content": {
        "general": "Clearly state the hypothesis for each question, and specify if the anticipated effect has a directionality (i.e. a one-tailed versus two-tailed hypothesis)."
      },
      "rationale": "Stating hypotheses clearly before searches are made helps to ensure that tests of those hypotheses are more adequately representative of true effects."

        "reviewer": "The systematic review a should have a descriptive title which clearly identifies the research question and the methodology (systematic review)."
      },
      "rationale": "Including information about the methodology in the title enables rapid identification of systematic reviews.\n\nThis can really help for projects compiling systematic reviews, and also for projects which need to exclude them such as meta analyses."

        "reviewer": "The systematic review should include the full search strategy string from each database searched. This should be specified in the protocol."
      },
      "rationale": "Including the specific search string allows other researchers to fully reproduce the methodology, and allows reviewers to identify possible omissions such as alternate terms from adjacent fields."
    },

      "name": "Search date",
      "scope": "review",

        "reviewer": "The systematic review should include the date each database was searched. If multiple searches on a single database are mentioned, dates should be included for all searches."

        "reviewer": "The systematic review should include an explanation of how unpublished or inaccessible information was approached."
      },
      "rationale": "Studies which have null results often remain unpublished [file drawer problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Publication_bias), which can skew otherwise-balanced attempts to aggregate information. Some reviews attempt to combat this by contacting authors to ask for unpublished work, following up search results for conference posters and presentations, etc. This _grey literature_ search can help to redress publication bias."
